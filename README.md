# Graphene-Layer-Analysis
analysis of the number of graphene layers using LEED:
A quantitative relationship between a LEED intensity ratio and the graphene thickness was established [J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 28, 958 (2010)].

This program was developed based on the aforementioned paper:
The intensity ratio of the primary graphene spot to the primary SiC spot is used to monitor the graphene thickness.
This ratio is effective for determining graphene thicknesses in the range 1 to 3 monolayers.

Operation of LEED conditions:
Beam Energy => 100 e.V
Ultra-High-Vacuum => base pressure e^-10 torr
